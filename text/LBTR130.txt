;0x27C992B6=It's part of every adult magazine: a several page spread with two nasty hot twins going at it with a guy who we'll call The Luckiest Man in the World. But is he really so lucky? Why is sex with twins ok, but inter-family sex considered foul and taboo? Reports are now coming in that sex with twins isn't all that great. One area man who declined to be named said, "It was a dream, right up until the point where two family members started 69ing. I'm sorry, I'm as red blooded as any man but that's difficult to deal with. I mean, why do you even need me? Why not call your dad over and bang him?" The twins' father refused to comment, only stating that they have a very close family.

;0x51977C99=Despite allegations of involvement in drug dealing, the cagey Uptown Riders motorcycle gang is launching a clothing line. Known for their turbo-tuned sports bikes, blaring rap music, and reckless stunt riding; the group hopes their street wear will be a hit with suburban white kids looking to impress their friends. "We going for the urban scene, but most the shit that gets bought in North Holland and Bohan ain't exactly street legal. We looking to sell to the white boys whose mommas are gonna pay for the genuine article." When not beating up anyone who thinks they look 'kind of gay' and blowing their own faces off with over cooked batches of meth, the Angels of Death Motorcycle Club spend their time monopolizing the biker merchandise market. Their website sells everything from branded meth pipes to baby diapers. We'll see if the Uptown Riders can carve out a niche of their own.

If you're not interested in having your internal organs feasted upon, we recommend you stay at home this evening. That said, Double D has a history of breaking into people's houses, so you may not be safe there either.
