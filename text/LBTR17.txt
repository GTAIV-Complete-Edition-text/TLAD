;0x5BE13656=A Los Santos man, who was prescribed medical marijuana for his glaucoma, has filed a lawsuit against his doctor and Cluckin Bell after ballooning from 180 to 350 pounds in less than six months. Phil Rosenburg, who can now back-roll a perfect blunt with just one hand, claims that he was not adequately informed of the side effects of his new medication. Rosenburg's attorney told Weazel News that his client now regularly devours a stuffed Pollo Toto Frito, a jar of mayonnaise, three pizzas and a plate of chocolate brownies covered in ranch sauce. He's lost his wallet seventeen times in the last month, developed an obsession with iconic bands of the 1970s and has started expressing increasingly left-wing political views. This is a landmark case and, if Rosenburg is awarded damages, predatory law firms are gearing up to get a class action suit against God, who created weed in the first place.

After collapsing on the job in what she describes as a work/life balance, McColland is fighting for all Liberty City businesses to allow 2 months paid vacation a year, flexible hours, yoga a flotation/isolation chamber spa on site.
