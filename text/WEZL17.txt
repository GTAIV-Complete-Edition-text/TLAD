;0x089004B1=Just when the homosexual community had gained a smatter of respectability by parodying themselves in reality TV shows and sitcoms, they go and ruin it for themselves. The death of Evan Moss, amateur body builder, drug addict and cum receptacle for "Gay" Tony Prince, got himself killed in the most brutal of fashions. This just goes to show that a deviant lifestyle will lead to an unfashionably early arrival at the sodomites' party in Hell. Deputy Mayor, Bryce Dawkins, weighed in on the issue "If America is to remain the moral Christian country I know it is, we need to take the vote away from these people. They can concentrate on picking out wallpaper and leave the choosing of our President to real men."
0x089004B1=正当真人秀和情景喜剧中出现的戏仿同性恋的片段使同性恋群体获得了零星的尊重的时候，他们自己毁掉了自己的声誉。业余健身者，吸毒者，"Gay" Tony 王子的私人肉便器Evan Moss在摧残人体的时尚中死掉了。这充分展示了不伦的生活方式会使他们过早地死去，在地狱中他们才能体验鸡奸的快乐。副市长Bryce Dawkins，对此表态 "如果美国要继续做一个有伦理和节操的基督教的国家, 我们不应该让同性恋者有投票权。如果同性恋有投票权的话，他们会一直从宣传单中挑挑拣拣，到头来我们的总统全是身材性感的男人了。"

;0xE35C2E66=We've had it up to hear with these lazy workers and their lazy lawsuits. Been fired for not showing up to work and taking too many days off? Sue. Boss used strong language about your lack of passion on a project but unlimited time and creativity for your personal blog? Sue. The mainstream media is to blame, which we are not by any means the mainstream media, despite the fact that we have a TV station in every city with at least one stoplight and are on every cable box in America. We're outsiders, we're angry, and these lazy twenty-somethings want to live on the dole of mommy or America and we're not having it. We prefer to be on the dole of corporate tax breaks and subsidies. Sandra McColland , you can sue all you want. If you don't love America and you are too tired from reading your communist pamphlets, die. Please.
0xE35C2E66=我们已经受够了每天听到职工的懒散和关于怠工的诉讼案。他们没有去工作或者因为旷工多日而被开除。当然。老板已经习惯于用严厉的口气批评你对项目的懈怠但是你并不节制自己使用博客的时间和你花在博客上的心思？当然。主流媒体应该为此负责， 或者并不仅仅是主流媒体，包括美国每一个城市的每一个路口出现的看板和公用电视都该对此负责。我们是局外人，但我们很生气，我们不能忍受这些懒惰的，二十几岁仍依靠妈妈的救济金来生存的酒囊饭袋。我们应该考虑的是企业减税和补贴。桑德拉·麦克兰 ,你爱诉讼谁就去诉讼谁。 如果你不爱美国或者读够了你的共产主义小册子，你死掉算了。
