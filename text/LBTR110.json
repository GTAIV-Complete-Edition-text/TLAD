Now, finally, Dalton and his wife Betania have decided to speak out against the constant barrage of accusations. In an exclusive interview, Betania told the Liberty Tree, \"He hasn't decorated my interior since the wedding night, I'll admit, but I know what my husband is and isn't. I'd never dream of going shopping for clothes without him. Nobody understands layering like Dalton. Can't a man wear fuchsia and depilate these days without being called gay?\" Randolph, who says that he is waging a one-man war against terracotta, is best-known for jumping up and down and clapping while squealing, \"What is this hot mess?\" when he walks into somebody's house for the first time. The jury might still be out on this one.",
