I love my brothers, all of them, but there's brothers who stood by me, (you, Jim, Clay and a few others) and brothers who said they would, and I think we know which camp Billy and Brian fall into. This is my life now. I can't ride into the sunset. I can't ride into anything. I'm stuck in a chair and I need money.

We can't beat the Deadbeats, but we can live alongside them. Billy will come out and go on a rampage. And Brian and those other clowns will drag us all along. It ain't going to be good. It's just a question of how bad.
