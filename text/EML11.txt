You're a rat, not a man.
0x5CAD6E0E=你的回复永远都是在自作聪明。我的背后就是祖国，你什么都没有。爸妈对你的看法是对的，你个自以为是的小混蛋。你给我记着，下次见到你我非收拾你一顿不可。你居然这么不尊重我，不尊重我的祖国，老子的祖国！我见过有人为国捐躯，你这个吸毒败类。不过幸好，你只会为了毒品或者金钱而死。你是个废物，不配做人。

;0xA7C5843D=What about the life you chose led you to make such stupid choices? Billy Grey? Give me a break. He always was an arsehole. Back in the neighborhood, he was a jackass thinking he was Jesus on an acid trip when we were fifteen and you were 10. That was a long time ago. i hope you don't still look up to that asshole, pardon my fucking French.
0xA7C5843D=你是犯了什么傻才会走上这么蠢的路的？因为Billy Grey吗？饶了我吧。他向来是个混蛋。以前住在一起的时候，我跟他15岁，你10岁，这个混蛋已经在嗑药后的幻觉世界当上帝了。很久以前就是这样了。希望你已经没有在敬重那个混蛋了，恕我说话粗俗。
