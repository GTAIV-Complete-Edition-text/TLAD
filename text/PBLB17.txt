;0x908547FE=Sweatshops. That's what the ragged, broken American college student finds when they hit the workforce. Fresh out of college, a place of learning, they want time to balance life by taking long hikes, getting colon cleansing, writing in a journal! How do we expect people to be part of a democracy when they are bogged down by oppressive work 8-9 hours a day? We feel sad for Sandra McColland, she's standing up for herself and fighting corporate America. Good for you. You go girl. These conservatives will take every ounce of your being. Sue them till they get a clue that work is about more than working.
0x908547FE=血汗工厂。这就是衣衫褴褛、心力交瘁的美国大学生在工作后所发现的。刚刚从大学，一个学习的地方毕业，他们想通过去远足，清洁结肠，为刊物写文章来平衡生活！当人们每天被8-9小时令人苦恼的工作拖住时，我们怎么能期望他们能成为民主国家的一员呢？我们为Sandra McColland感到难过，她为了自己挺身而出与美国企业界抗争。这对你有益。加油姑娘。这些保守的人会榨干你每分每毫。起诉他们直到他们理解工作不仅仅是去工作。
