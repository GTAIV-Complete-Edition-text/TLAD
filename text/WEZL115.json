From Vinewood cocaine parties to ecstasy-fueled swinging suburban romps, to pre-schoolers having their drinks laced with acid and college kids shooting up heroin, nothing says 'liberal drop out' like a family ruined by the ravages of drugs. Now, police are saying there is an incontrovertible link between drugs coming into our city and our nation and the terror threat we all face. It's the thing liberals love most - the fact that their licentious behavior is putting the lives of all of us at deadly risk.",
            "translated": "我们都知道自由主义者热爱毒品。从好麦坞的可卡因派对到充斥着摇头丸的郊区狂欢，从学龄前儿童喝迷幻药到大学生注射海洛因，没有什么比被毒品毁掉的家庭更能说明「自由主义的堕落」了。现在，警方称进入本市以及我国的毒品和我们面临的恐怖威胁之间存在不容置疑的联系。这正是自由派的最爱——用他们的肆意妄为把我们所有人的性命置于致命威胁之中。",
