;0x0DBF3EFD=Man, i fucked things up. I know I did. But you weren't a saint. You weren't. You're who you are, and you do bad shit. and hanging out with you made me do bad shit, even though it ain't your fault. but i did bad shit to you, because you were my world. i thought you would kill me and you didn't. so that makes you a better person than some. i'm so glad we are friends now.
0x0DBF3EFD=亲爱的，我是个烂人，这我知道。但你也不是什么圣贤。你就是你，你做破事，而跟你一起厮混害的我也整了一堆破事，尽管这不是你的错。我做蠢事拖你下水，因为你就是我的全部。我以为你会杀了我但你没有，这就说明你比某些人强多了。我很高兴我们现在是朋友。

0x3D1C5C31=小艾，干那些蠢事没多大意义。我们所在的这个世界就是狗屁但我们还就属于它。事情不应该这样的，而我也不是什么居家好男人。我们是朋友，但仅此而已，不复以往了。我不能眼睁睁看你继续吸更多的毒品了。祝你好运，这段时间洁身自好。Johnny

0xB4AD8CCF=我的人生乱七八糟。这不能怪我，我被从那设施里赶了出来。那不是我的可卡因。我爱你，Johnny。我爱你。毒品不是坏东西，你就是我的毒品。呃，Johnny，你能借我点钱吗，就几天？我想念你，想得肝肠寸断。
