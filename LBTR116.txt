;0x29FC702D=Security officials were unavailable for comment, but did ask for more funding, especially desiring a better gym, and more breaks, blaming work stress on the recent problems at the Airport.

No wonder all these drugs get through and people keep getting shot."

;0x65216DD4=It appears that it takes more than a boatload of booze and a smorgasbord of tiny reproductive organs to have a hit series these days. It was billed as: 'One island full of genetic disasters' but CNT's primetime show, Hermaphrodite Island, has been cancelled after just one season following disastrous viewing figures. The producers tried everything from Bikini Tuesdays to Absinthe Thursdays to Jockstrap Fridays but, apart from a confusing fumble between Dave and Ken in the mud pit, passion failed to ignite between the contestants and angry reality TV fans began switching off in their droves. Phoebe, the star of the show, says her calendar will be out in time for Christmas and will excite both men and women.

;0x80C19DBE=A routine arrest for drugs trafficking on the flight into Francis International from Bogota ended in chaos and carnage. A suspected drug smuggler was freed by an accomplice amid a hail of bullets in scenes not seen at the airport since the last major security breach. The smuggler was freed and rescued by an accomplice as a bloody fire storm ensued, and security and innocent by standers were killed. The suspect is described as being "probably foreign" with "a foreign, creepy vibe, like a rapist." Or "one of those white guys who becomes a terrorist."

;0xC2D71394=Now they're charging for everything. Tiny, germ-infested pillow? $10. Glass of warm water? $5. In-flight magazine full of old toenails and dried vomit? $4. Stale bag of party mix? $6. The final insult is the $3 to take a dump in a restroom the size of a coffin Air Sol began charging. A new range of adult protective underwear called Flypers has been selling out in airports across the country. We used to have the most envied airline industry in the world. Now we sit in our filth for five hours. Like foreigners.
0xC2D71394=现在航班上的什么东西都得花钱。很小的，细菌遍布的枕头？ $10。一杯热水？ $5。 充斥着旧脚趾甲和干呕吐物的舱内杂志？ $4。 一袋陈旧的餐具? $6。最令人气愤的是，从今往后你得花$3才能到棺材大小的卫生间里上一次厕所。 一种叫做“飞人”的成人纸尿裤正在全国各大机场热销。我们曾经有过世界上最成功的航空服务。 现在我们只能在脏兮兮的机舱里熬过5小时。就像外国人一样。

;0xD0222E2A=Remember the good old days of air travel? Getting served endless miniature bottles of cheap vodka by statuesque blondes in low-cut tops and short skirts? Flying used to be considered the height of luxury. Now you have to print off your own ticket, check in your own bags and submit yourself to humiliating security checks before being herded like cattle onto a filthy plane to sit for 2 hours on the runway because an undertrained stoner in air traffic control hit ESC by mistake.
